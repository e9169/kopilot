# Documentation

## Getting Started

Kopilot is an AI-powered assistant for Kubernetes cluster management. This guide will help you get up and running in minutes.

### Installation

#### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/e9169/kopilot.git
cd kopilot
make install
```

---

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Kopilot uses the **GitHub Copilot SDK**, which requires:

1. **GitHub Copilot subscription** (Individual, Business, or Enterprise)
2. **GitHub Copilot CLI** installed and authenticated

```bash
# Install Copilot CLI (choose one method)
npm install -g @githubnext/github-copilot-cli
# or
gh extension install github/gh-copilot
# or
brew install github/gh-copilot/gh-copilot

# Authenticate
copilot auth login
```

### AI Models

Kopilot works with **all models available through your GitHub Copilot subscription**.

**Default models:**
- **gpt-4o-mini** - Used for simple queries and status checks (cost-effective)
- **gpt-4o** - Automatically selected for troubleshooting and complex operations

**Customization:**

You can use any model from your Copilot subscription by setting environment variables:

```bash
# Use different models
export KOPILOT_MODEL_COST_EFFECTIVE="claude-3.5-sonnet"
export KOPILOT_MODEL_PREMIUM="o1-preview"

# Then run kopilot
./bin/kopilot
```

Supported models include: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `o1-preview`, `o1-mini`, `claude-3.5-sonnet`, and any other models available in your GitHub Copilot plan.

No API key configuration needed - authentication is handled through GitHub Copilot CLI.

## Basic Usage

### Starting Kopilot

Kopilot offers two execution modes to balance safety and functionality:

**Read-Only Mode (Default - Recommended)**

```bash
# Start in read-only mode (safest, default)
kopilot
```

- Blocks all write operations (scale, delete, apply, etc.)
- Perfect for exploration and monitoring
- Prevents accidental cluster modifications
- No confirmation prompts needed

**Interactive Mode**

```bash
# Start in interactive mode
kopilot --interactive
```

- Allows write operations with confirmation
- Shows exact kubectl command before execution
- Requires explicit yes/no approval for changes
- Read-only commands execute immediately

**Runtime Mode Switching**

You can switch modes during a session without restarting:

```
> /readonly          # Switch to read-only mode
> /interactive       # Switch to interactive mode
> /mode             # Show current mode
```

### Example Session

```bash
kopilot
```

Example queries:
- "Show me all pods in the default namespace"
- "What's the status of my deployments?"
- "Why is my nginx pod crashing?"
- "Compare resource usage across namespaces"

For write operations, switch to interactive mode:
```
> /interactive
> scale nginx deployment to 5 replicas
⚠️  Write Operation: kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=5
Do you want to proceed? (yes/no): yes
```

## Advanced Topics

### Intelligent Model Selection

Kopilot automatically selects the optimal model based on your query:

- **Simple queries** (list, status, health) → `gpt-4o-mini`
- **Complex operations** (troubleshooting, scaling, debugging) → `gpt-4o`

This provides 50-70% cost reduction while maintaining quality for critical tasks.

See the [Model Selection documentation](https://github.com/e9169/kopilot/blob/main/docs/MODEL_SELECTION.md) for more details.

### Execution Modes

Kopilot supports different execution modes:

- **Interactive** - Chat-based interface
- **Command** - Single command execution
- **Daemon** - Background monitoring

See [Execution Modes](../docs/EXECUTION_MODES.md) for more details.

## Examples

### Deploy a Simple Application

```bash
kopilot "deploy a redis instance with persistence"
```

### Debug a Failing Pod

```bash
kopilot "why is my nginx pod failing?"
```

### Optimize Resources

```bash
kopilot "analyze resource usage and suggest improvements"
```

### Backup Configuration

```bash
kopilot "export all configmaps in the production namespace"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot connect to cluster"**
- Ensure your kubeconfig is properly configured
- Check that `kubectl` works: `kubectl get nodes`

**"GitHub Copilot not authenticated"**
- Run: `copilot auth login`
- Ensure you have an active GitHub Copilot subscription

**"Model not responding"**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key is valid
- Try a different model
